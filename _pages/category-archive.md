Guess what! I'm super nice and I will code you whatever you desire, no matter how hard it is! Just email at aveemo@veraveemo.co.uk your request and any other details and your first request will be free! Any requests after the free one will be paid, and you can pay me here: [https://paypal.me/VeraVeemo](https://paypal.me/VeraVeemo)
 Or you could donate for my hard working!

Anywho, let's get onto the projects!

# QUICK DISCLAIMER!
The next 3 projects are outdated and will no longer be worked on!


## 1. VLCMP_RPC (requested by @pepsicart (discord))
[https://github.com/VeraVeemo/VLCMP_RPC](https://github.com/VeraVeemo/VLCMP_RPC)
- VLC Media Player RPC for Discord.

For my first project, it went well, it's just a simple python code that edits your profile to addd RPC much like Vencord's CustomRPC.

It has a ton of flaws, but me and pepsicart have been working silently however we have been working on it less and less to the point I dont think you can consider it "work".

It's pretty simple, you do the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/VeraVeemo/VLCMP_RPC/blob/main/README.md) file and launch the .py file whenever you're running VLC or in the background!

## 2. MidiToTXT (requested by @anymorn (discord))
[https://github.com/VeraVeemo/MidiToTXT](https://github.com/VeraVeemo/MidiToTXT)
- Python code that can convert ".mid" files to basic text.

Second project which I immediately did after the first. It went amazing! This .py file will convert your .mid file into plain text!

The reason this went so well was because of the mistakes I made, the first era was making mistakes:
1. Seconds were off
2. Lots of numbers were just 0

This was the first project I had to go back to, which teached me a lot about how tags on github are annoying--wait that's not related... ANYWAY! With the new version it meant I can add new things to the code.

Wait this isn't a blog post, well uhh...

The features of the code are pretty simple, you yet again follow the steps in the [README.md](https://github.com/VeraVeemo/MidiToTXT/blob/main/README.md) file and then enter your .mid file path and it'll show:
1. If the note is on or off
2. Note name
3. Velocity
4. Ticks
5. Seconds

This is all included in V2 of the code!

## 3. YoutubeToMP3
[https://github.com/VeraVeemo/YoutubeToMP3](https://github.com/VeraVeemo/YoutubeToMP3)
- A very simple and straight forward python code that asks for a YouTube URL and downloads it into an mp3

I was tired of using sketchy websites that probably steal my data to download .mp3 files from YouTube, so I decided lets make my own one!

This is the most straight foward code, you just follow steps in [README.md](https://github.com/VeraVeemo/YoutubeToMP3/blob/main/README.md) and then run the file, enter the YouTube URL you desire to download and bam, it's in a folder called Downloads!

That's it for this code, also the Downloads folder is not the one you always use.

That's all!
