Hello, and welcome to my page! I'm AVeemo, the silliest developer and gamer!

I make custom projects/repo's from your liking! You can request one by DMing me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/333585549837336577)! If you'd like to participate in Veemoworks, feel free to drop an application at [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/8nCFSskjBAhevQt39)!
 Oh Veemoworks? That's just an organization I run, we make projects to aid you and others!

<ins>About Me:<ins>
======
Hello! I'm **Jade!** I am both a developer and developer, and what I love most is taking a creative idea and figuring out how I can bring it to fruition by building tools, games, and/or other projects. I tend to spend the majority of my free time making something, whether that be coding quietly on my own, working on a coding project with my buddies, or spending the time to learn something new with coding and technology.

<ins>**As a creator, this is what I enjoy doing:**<ins>
- Coding a project alone or with one of my coding buddies
- Playing games and developing games (in games like Roblox!)
- Watching a video online learning a new tool or growing a skill/ability
- Talking to other creators and developers
  
<ins>**My tools/language(s) that I utilize are:**<ins>
- **Python** (the language I am most adept at)
- **JavaScript** (Still a complete beginner)
- **CSS** (I know like 1-3 things...)
- Any other tool or language that will help me take an idea and make it happen!

I also have my own little organization [**Veemoworks**](https://github.com/Veemoworks) where I aggregate and organize my projects and ideas, and new ideas I hope to create someday!

<ins>My Skills:<ins>
======
1. Development - Python is my strongest programming language so far with JavaScript and .css being next in line!
2. UX Design - Not good at "designing", but I'm pretty good at layouts, formats etc.
3. Game Development - While not my own code, I make games in games e.g. Roblox. I do hope to make my own game when I have free time however.
4. Tools - VSCode, Pycharm, Github etc., I'm pretty talented and I like teaching so if you need help, feel free to message me!
